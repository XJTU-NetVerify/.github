# Network Verification @ANTS, XJTU

We are researchers from the ANTS (Advanced NeTworked System) group of Xi'an Jiaotong University.
We focus on network verfication, an exciting new direction in computer network: it leverages formal methods, together with simulation/emulation to ensure the correctness of large and complex computer networks, e.g., datacenter networks, and wide area networks.
We have proposed verifiers like APKeep (NSDI'20), MNV (CoNEXT'23), DNA (NSDI'22), SRE (SIGCOMM'22), and Expresso (SIGCOMM'24).
Some of the work have already been open sourced.
